# How Did I Start This Project?
In the "Wooridachi" content team, we had a problem: we were running out of content ideas quickly because we were mainly picking topics based on our own interests. To keep the app fresh and relatable for users, we needed a better way to stay on top of what was trending. But it wasn't easy to analyze keywords since Korea and Japan often have unique slang and new terms on social media.

# How Did I Address This Challenge?
To tackle this, I decided to analyze popular YouTube content in both Korea and Japan. Since video titles often have trendy or newly coined words, I knew it could be tricky to get accurate keywords from them. So, I created a scoring system to identify trends based on views, comments, likes, and subscribers instead of just keyword frequency. I also added a filter to break down trends by category, so we could see what's popular in specific areas. This all came together in a dashboard that made it easy to track trends.

# Result
Once the dashboard was up, I shared it with the team, and it made a big difference! We could now see what’s trending in both Japan and Korea at a glance. For example, we found that K-pop, mukbang videos, and vlogs are big in Korea, while Japan leans more toward virtual YouTubers, anime, and gaming. This dashboard didn’t just help the content team—it also gave everyone a better sense of each country’s trends. Thanks to the dashboard, we went from picking 1–3 topics each month to 4–6, speeding up our process a lot.

# Future Application
This project taught me that good teamwork and regular communication make a big difference in solving problems. I realized that as a data analyst, it’s not just about analyzing data but also understanding what people actually need. Looking back, I wish I’d checked in with the team more before building the dashboard to get even clearer insights. In the future, I’ll make sure to share results along the way to better respond to feedback. Next time, I’ll aim to pick the most relevant data upfront to make decision-making faster and smoother.
